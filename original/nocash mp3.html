<font size="+2">nocash mp3 decoder</font><br>
Here's my approach on mp3 decoding.
The project is based on the keyj minimp3 source code,
manually ported to 80x86 asm code.
The goals are to figure out how to decode mp3 files, and to make it fast
enough to work on older hardware.
<br>
The current version is for Windows 9x or later, it should work on something like 80486DX2-??MHz (not tested yet).
I am quite optimistic that I can port it to PSX or GBA consoles.
That, if neccessary with reduced output quality (but without requiring users to convert their .mp3 files to lower bitrates).
<br>
<br>
<b>Feedback needed...</b><br>
Before trying to port the code to MIPS or ARM, I would be glad about some
feedback on the 80x86 version.
<br>
<b>Testing:</b> I still need benchmarks for <b>retro PCs</b>
(like a working 80486DX2-66MHz, or anything from 80386 to Pentium I).
Please download the .mp3 file (linked in benchmarks section), and run mp3play
with /test switch, then copy/paste the screen output (the cycle counters may
be all zero on older PCs, but the millisecond value should work everywhere).
And, of course, check if the sound comes out okay (if the PC is too slow,
try using the /fast /mono /half switches).
<br>
<b>DOS Version:</b> There's currently only the win32 version
(but the HXDOS extension should be able to run win32 code in DOS).
I am also considering to make a native DOS version (but only if 80486 benchmarks
do confirm that the code could be fast enough to run on yet older PCs).
<br>
<b>Code Reviews:</b> Suggestions for making the code faster would be welcome
(for the overall logic you could look at my asm code, or the keyj minimp3 high
level code). Maybe there are ways to make the code more straight forward,
or to get away with fewer multiplications...?<br>
Something like MMX would be probably faster, but PCs that do support MMX are
probably fast enough for mp3 anyways (unless one wants to combine audio/video decoding).
<br>
<b>Expert Question:</b>
Mp3 decoders are converting samples from "frequency domain to time 
domain".
I don't know if that means what I think, and how and where the code is 
doing
that.
Anyways, could one tweak those frequencies to produce output at 
different sample
rates? Like converting 48kHz to 44kHz or 24kHz (if the sound hardware 
doesn't support 48kHz, or if the CPU is too slow for that).

As a last resort, one could resample the mp3 file before playback.
That's uncomfortable, but a lower samplerate can be much faster
(than the /half /quarter switches),
and a lower bitrate can save diskspace (but isn't much faster).

And finally, one could switch from mp3 to mp2. This may require a slightly higher bitrate, but can be about 33% faster than mp2.
The problem is to find mp2 encoders.
<br>
Tools like "toolame" or "twolame" pretend to support mp2 encoding, but they're
usually plain source code without binaries (and even if you can find a win32
executable: it'll just say that it requires a newer windows version).
<br>
The only known working mp2 encoder appears to be
https://www.rarewares.org/files/mp3/mp2enc.zip (albeit working is relative;
it can do 44kHz/stereo, but fails on any attempt to encode 22kHz or mono).
<br>
Note: mp1 and mp2 are more or less identical: mp1 uses more simplified
headers, but mp1 uses thrice as many headers per second, and mp1 tends to
use higher bitrates (overall, mp1 is a bit worse and slower than mp2).

<font size="+2">other decoder: fixed-point <a href="https://keyj.emphy.de/minimp3/">keyj minimp3</a>, 2007 Martin J. Fiedler</font><br>
This is a nice small fixed-point decoder (and is itself based on 
FFmpeg). It claims to be rather slow, although the code doesn't look 
bad, apart from a few suboptimal things:
<br>
<ul>
<li>The bitstream reader looks very slow, using the OPEN/CLOSE_READER 
functions on each and every bitstream access is just crazy, same for 
UPDATE_READER (although that might work on CPUs with fast cache, and 
strong support for unaligned big-endian memory accesses).</li>
<li>There are a few tricks that went wrong, for example the synth 
function tries to compute two samples at once to avoid an extra memory 
access (the problem is that 80x86 doesn't have enough CPU registers for 
such tricks, so the number of memory accesses goes up instead of down).</li>
<li>The init function uses floating-point, making it very difficult to 
implement without FPU. The init is rather slow (computing the same 
values over and over again, only to apply slightly different factors to 
them), and the pow function looks bugged (calculating 0^n returns 
-infinite instead of zero).</li>
<li>The accuracy is fairly good, but could be better (FRAC=15, WFRAC=14 
isn't optimal, FRAC=18, WFRAC=11 would be more balanced for same 
OUT_SHIFT, and perfect (but 10% slower) would be FRAC=22, WFRAC=30).</li>
<li>The intensity_stereo decoding has various bugs (the is_table_lsf is 
too small, it lacks support for the NO_INTENSITY flag, and the previous 
scale factor logic looks broken, etc). That's not so much of a problem 
because intensity_stereo is rarely used, but it's better to replace it 
by the stereo logic from lieff's decoder.</li>
<li>The player_win32 sample code is unstable (it doesn't distinguish 
between WOM_DONE and WOM_OPEN/CLOSE, and manually calls AudioCallback to
 enqueue the first 8 frames, and actual AudioCallback's can occur 
simultaneously while executing those manual calls) (easy workaround 
would be to enclose the first 8 calls in waveOutPause/Restart).</li>
<li>An executable version did <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150923042747/http://keyj.emphy.de/files/projects/minimp3.tar.gz">exist</a>, but it does just crash on my PC (win98), and the auther seems to have deleted it because virus scanners.</li>
</ul>

<font size="+2">other decoder: floating-point <a href="https://github.com/lieff/minimp3/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">lieff minimp3</a>, 2018 lieff</font><br>
This is another small mp3 decoder, which is confusingly also called 
minimp3. It's using floating-point, but claims to be very fast and 
accurate.
<br>
<ul>
<li>The surprisingly fast benchmarks refer to low bitrate mono files, normal mp3's are probably more than twice as slow.</li>
<li>The absurd fast timings for l3_sin1k0db.bit are because the 
benchmark table is incorrectly listing it as mono 16 seconds instead of 
stereo 8 seconds. </li>
<li>The comparision to keyj minimp3 is rather misleading (its init 
function seems to take approx. 16M cycles, which are counted as extra 8M
 clks/s in case of small 2s files).</li>
<li>The benchmarks are from a newer PC, it would be interesting how it 
performs on older PCs, including such without SIMD/SSE extensions, or 
without any FPU at all.</li>
<li>The whole source code for this decoder is hidden away in a large .h 
file. Executable versions do not exist, perhaps also due to virus 
scanners.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><hr><!---------------------->
<font size="+2">other asm decoders</font><br>
mp3 asm decoders are somewhat hard to find, if they do exist at all.
Some source code libraries seem to contain asm code, but that's buried in a
huge library, and it's often only supporting exotic things like simd/sse/neon,
and only using small asm snippets for the imdct/dct core functions, with other
functions coded in high level language.
<br>
There's reportedly something called "100% assembly coded mpeg-2/mp3 decoder",
but there's little info if it's been released as source code or binary,
and for which processor and which operating system.
<p></p><hr><!---------------------->
<font size="+2">compression ratios</font><br>
Historically, mp3 did reach compression ratios of about 1:10
(compared to uncompressed CD audio).
But, whilst small is good for compression,
many users and distributors think that bigger is better.
These days, the typical mp3 ratio is about 1:5,
which is barely better (or even worse) than ADPCM.
Additionally, mp3 can be vandalized with ID3 headers (which do sometimes
contain up to 2 Mbytes of lossless hi-res bitmaps in .png format).
